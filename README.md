# Output Data Object/Array into Formatted Table (Elixir)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future Elixir projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted terminal table.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/elixir-data2table
  cd elixir-data2table
  elixir main.ex
  ```
*Data will instantly output formatted to Terminal/Console*
